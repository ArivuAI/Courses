# Experiment 8: Sequential Bayesian Inference

## üìö Overview

This experiment teaches **Sequential Bayesian Inference** - the process of updating probability distributions as new evidence arrives over time. Building on Experiment 7's Bayesian Networks, we explore how to make progressive diagnoses as symptoms develop day by day.

### üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this experiment, you will:

1. ‚úÖ Understand sequential Bayesian inference and iterative probability updates
2. ‚úÖ Implement step-by-step Bayesian algorithms
3. ‚úÖ Visualize how confidence evolves with accumulating evidence
4. ‚úÖ Apply sequential inference to medical diagnosis
5. ‚úÖ Compare single-step vs multi-step inference strategies
6. ‚úÖ Make early decisions based on partial evidence
7. ‚úÖ Handle temporal data in probabilistic models

## üîë Key Concepts

### Sequential Bayesian Inference

**Definition**: Updating probability distributions iteratively as new evidence arrives.

**Formula**:
```
P(H | E‚ÇÅ, E‚ÇÇ, ..., E‚Çô) = P(E‚Çô | H) √ó P(H | E‚ÇÅ, ..., E‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ) / P(E‚Çô)
```

**Key Principle**: Yesterday's posterior becomes today's prior!

### Properties

1. **Order Independence**: Final result same regardless of evidence order (with conditional independence)
2. **Convergence**: More evidence ‚Üí probabilities converge to true values
3. **Efficiency**: Don't need to reprocess all evidence
4. **Interpretability**: Can track confidence at each step

### When to Use

‚úÖ **Use Sequential Inference When**:
- Evidence arrives over time
- Need to make decisions before all data available
- Want to track confidence evolution
- Working with streaming data

‚ùå **Don't Use When**:
- All evidence available simultaneously
- Evidence not conditionally independent
- Computational cost prohibitive

## üíª Example Usage

### Basic Sequential Inference

```python
# Load data
with open('data/sequential_diagnosis_data.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Get patient case
patient = data['sequential_patient_cases'][0]

# Perform sequential inference
prob_history = sequential_inference(patient['symptom_sequence'])

# Display results
for step in prob_history:
    print(f"Day {step['day']}: {step['evidence']}")
    for disease, prob in step['probabilities'].items():
        print(f"  P({disease}) = {prob:.4f}")
```

### Visualize Probability Evolution

```python
# Extract probability trajectories
days = [step['day'] for step in prob_history]
flu_probs = [step['probabilities']['Flu'] for step in prob_history]
covid_probs = [step['probabilities']['COVID-19'] for step in prob_history]

# Plot
plt.plot(days, flu_probs, label='Flu', marker='o')
plt.plot(days, covid_probs, label='COVID-19', marker='s')
plt.xlabel('Day')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.title('Disease Probability Evolution')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Probabilities don't sum to 1
- **Solution**: Check normalization step in `bayesian_update()`
- **Cause**: Numerical precision errors

**Issue**: All probabilities become 0
- **Solution**: Use log probabilities for numerical stability
- **Cause**: Underflow from multiplying many small numbers

**Issue**: Results don't match expected
- **Solution**: Verify CPT values and conditional independence assumptions
- **Cause**: Incorrect probability tables or dependencies

**Issue**: Slow performance
- **Solution**: Optimize update loop, use vectorized operations
- **Cause**: Inefficient implementation
