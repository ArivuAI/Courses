# Experiment 2: Concept Learning - Restaurant Recommendation System

## 📋 Overview

This experiment provides a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to concept learning algorithms applied to a real-world restaurant recommendation problem:
- **Find-S Algorithm**: Finds the most specific preference pattern from enjoyed restaurants
- **Candidate Elimination Algorithm**: Maintains a version space of all consistent preference patterns

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this experiment, you will:

1. **Apply Concept Learning to Recommendations**: Learn how apps like Yelp and UberEats personalize suggestions
2. **Implement Find-S**: Build a system that learns user preferences from positive examples
3. **Implement Candidate Elimination**: Create and maintain version spaces for preference learning
4. **Analyze Preference Patterns**: Visualize how user preferences evolve with more data
5. **Connect to Business Value**: Understand how ML drives engagement and revenue

## 📊 Dataset

The experiment uses a **Restaurant Recommendation** dataset with:

- **6 attributes**: Cuisine, Price, Location, Ambiance, Service, Parking
- **12 training examples**: Mix of enjoyed and not-enjoyed restaurants
- **4 test examples**: For evaluating learned preferences
- **Target concept**: WillEnjoy (Yes/No)

### Example Data Point

```json
{
  "Cuisine": "Italian",
  "Price": "Moderate",
  "Location": "Downtown",
  "Ambiance": "Casual",
  "Service": "Fast",
  "Parking": "Available",
  "WillEnjoy": "Yes"
}
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How is this different from Experiment 1?**
A: Same algorithms, different domain! Experiment 1 used outdoor activities, this uses restaurant recommendations. This helps you see how the same ML concepts apply across different problems.

**Q: Can I use this for other recommendation problems?**
A: Absolutely! The same approach works for movie recommendations, product suggestions, music discovery, etc. Just change the attributes!

**Q: How long does this experiment take?**
A: The main notebook takes 1-2 hours to complete. Assignments add 11-15 hours total.

**Q: Do I need to complete Experiment 1 first?**
A: Not required, but recommended! Experiment 1 introduces the concepts, this one reinforces them with a new domain.
