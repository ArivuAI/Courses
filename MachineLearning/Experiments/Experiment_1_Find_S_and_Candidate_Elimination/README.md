# Experiment 1: Find-S and Candidate Elimination Algorithms

## 📋 Overview

This experiment provides a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to two fundamental concept learning algorithms:
- **Find-S Algorithm**: Finds the most specific hypothesis consistent with positive examples
- **Candidate Elimination Algorithm**: Maintains a version space of all consistent hypotheses

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this experiment, you will:

1. **Understand Concept Learning**: Learn how machines learn patterns from examples
2. **Implement Find-S**: Build a system that finds specific hypotheses from positive examples
3. **Implement Candidate Elimination**: Create and maintain version spaces with S and G boundaries
4. **Analyze Hypothesis Evolution**: Visualize how hypotheses change as more examples are processed
5. **Apply to Real Problems**: Use these algorithms for practical classification tasks
