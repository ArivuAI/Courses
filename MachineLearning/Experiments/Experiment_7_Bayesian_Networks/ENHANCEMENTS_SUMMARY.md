## 📦 What Was Added

### 🆕 Section 8: Case Study 1 - Email Spam Classification (NEW!)

**Complete Spam Filter Implementation**:

**Code Cell 1: Spam Classification System** (~230 lines)
- **Network Structure**:
  - Email_Type → Features (Contains_Free, Has_Links, Urgent_Language, From_Known_Sender, Has_Attachments)
  - Simple Bayesian Network with 1 parent node and 5 feature nodes
  
- **Prior Probabilities**:
  - P(Spam) = 0.30 (30% spam rate - typical for email)
  - P(Not_Spam) = 0.70 (70% legitimate emails)
  
- **Conditional Probability Tables**:
  - P(Contains_Free | Spam) = 0.80 vs P(Contains_Free | Not_Spam) = 0.10
  - P(Has_Links | Spam) = 0.85 vs P(Has_Links | Not_Spam) = 0.40
  - P(Urgent_Language | Spam) = 0.75 vs P(Urgent_Language | Not_Spam) = 0.15
  - P(From_Known_Sender | Spam) = 0.05 vs P(From_Known_Sender | Not_Spam) = 0.70
  - P(Has_Attachments | Spam) = 0.40 vs P(Has_Attachments | Not_Spam) = 0.25
  
- **Test Cases**: 4 sample emails
  - Email 1: Promotional spam (free offer, links, urgent)
  - Email 2: Work email from colleague (known sender, attachment)
  - Email 3: Phishing attempt (all spam indicators)
  - Email 4: Newsletter subscription (known sender, links)
  
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy calculation
  - Confidence levels for each prediction
  - Detailed classification results

**Code Cell 2: Spam Classification Visualizations** (~120 lines) 🆕 NEW
- **4 Professional Visualizations**:
  1. **Feature Probability Heatmap**: P(Feature=Yes | Email_Type) for all features
  2. **Classification Results**: Bar chart showing spam probability for each test email
  3. **Feature Importance**: Horizontal bar chart showing discriminative power of each feature
  4. **Confusion Matrix**: 2x2 matrix showing classification accuracy

**Real-World Context**:

**Code Cell 1: Credit Risk Assessment** (~240 lines)
- **Network Structure**:
  - Income, Credit_Score, Employment → Default_Risk
  - 3 risk factor nodes converging to 1 outcome node
  
- **Prior Probabilities**:
  - Income: High (25%), Medium (50%), Low (25%)
  - Credit Score: Excellent (20%), Good (40%), Fair (25%), Poor (15%)
  - Employment: Stable (70%), Unstable (30%)
  
- **Base Default Rates** (by credit score):
  - Excellent: 2% default rate
  - Good: 8% default rate
  - Fair: 20% default rate
  - Poor: 45% default rate
  
- **Adjustment Factors**:
  - Income multipliers: High (0.7), Medium (1.0), Low (1.5)
  - Employment multipliers: Stable (0.8), Unstable (1.3)
  
- **Test Cases**: 5 loan applications
  - Applicant 1: High income, excellent credit, stable job → Low risk
  - Applicant 2: Low income, poor credit, unstable job → High risk
  - Applicant 3: Medium income, good credit, stable job → Low risk
  - Applicant 4: Medium income, fair credit, unstable job → Medium risk
  - Applicant 5: High income, good credit, unstable job → Low risk
  
- **Decision Rules**:
  - P(Default) < 10%: APPROVE (Low risk)
  - 10% ≤ P(Default) < 25%: REVIEW (Medium risk)
  - P(Default) ≥ 25%: DENY (High risk)
  
- **Performance Summary**:
  - Total applications processed
  - Breakdown by decision (Approve/Review/Deny)
  - Risk level distribution

**Real-World Context**:
- Banks use Bayesian Networks for credit scoring
- Helps make fair, data-driven lending decisions
- Reduces default rates and financial losses
- Complies with fair lending regulations (ECOA, FCRA)
