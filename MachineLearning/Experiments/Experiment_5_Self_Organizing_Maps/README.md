## ‚ùì FAQs

**Q: What makes SOM different from K-Means?**  
A: SOM preserves topology (smooth transitions between clusters) and creates 2D visualization of high-dimensional data. K-Means just assigns hard cluster labels.

**Q: How do I choose the SOM grid size?**  
A: Rule of thumb: Grid size ‚âà 5‚àön where n is number of samples. For 100 samples, 10√ó10 grid is good.

**Q: Can SOM handle categorical features?**  
A: Not directly. You need to encode categorical features as numerical (one-hot encoding) first.

**Q: How long does SOM training take?**  
A: For 100 samples with 6 features on 10√ó10 grid: ~1-2 seconds. Scales linearly with data size.

**Q: Is this production-ready code?**  
A: The notebook is educational. For production, add error handling, logging, and optimization.
