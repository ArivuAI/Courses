**Size**: 100 customers  
**Features**: 6 (1 identifier + 5 numerical features)

#### Features

| Feature | Type | Range | Description |
|---------|------|-------|-------------|
| **CustomerID** | Identifier | C001-C100 | Unique customer identifier |
| **Age** | Numeric | 18-70 | Customer age in years |
| **AnnualIncome** | Numeric | 15-150 | Annual income in thousands of dollars |
| **SpendingScore** | Numeric | 1-100 | Score based on spending behavior |
| **PurchaseFrequency** | Numeric | 1-30 | Number of purchases per month |
| **WebsiteVisits** | Numeric | 0-50 | Number of website visits per month |

#### Sample Data

```json
{
  "CustomerID": "C001",
  "Age": 19,
  "AnnualIncome": 15,
  "SpendingScore": 39,
  "PurchaseFrequency": 2,
  "WebsiteVisits": 5
}
```

#### Expected Clusters

The dataset is designed to reveal **4 natural customer segments**:

1. **Budget Shoppers**: Low income, low spending, occasional buyers
2. **High Earners, Low Spenders**: High income but conservative spending
3. **Target Customers**: Medium income, high spending, frequent buyers
4. **Premium Customers**: High income, high spending, very frequent buyers
