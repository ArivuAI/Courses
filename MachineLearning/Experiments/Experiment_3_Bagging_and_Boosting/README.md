# Experiment 3: Ensemble Learning - Bagging and Boosting

## 📋 Overview

This experiment provides a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to ensemble learning methods applied to medical diagnosis:
- **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**: Parallel ensemble that reduces variance
- **Boosting (AdaBoost)**: Sequential ensemble that reduces bias

Learn how combining multiple models creates more accurate predictions than any single model!

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this experiment, you will:

1. **Master Ensemble Learning**: Understand how combining models improves predictions
2. **Implement Bagging**: Build Random Forest-style classifiers with bootstrap sampling
3. **Implement Boosting**: Create AdaBoost classifiers that focus on hard examples
4. **Evaluate Performance**: Compare ensemble methods against single models using multiple metrics
5. **Apply to Healthcare**: Use ML for medical diagnosis and risk prediction
