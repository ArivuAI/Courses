    "**FOIL = Sequential Covering + Variables + Specialized Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from Propositional Sequential Covering:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Introduction:** Each literal can add new variables\n",
    "   - Current rule: `GrandDaughter(x, y) ←`\n",
    "   - Can add: `Father(y, z)` where z is NEW\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binding Evaluation:** Must consider all possible variable bindings\n",
    "   - One example can create multiple bindings!\n",
    "   - Example: `Father(Tom, Bob), Father(Bob, Alice)`\n",
    "   - Creates bindings: {x=Alice, y=Bob, z=Tom} AND {x=Alice, y=Tom, z=Bob}\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **FoilGain Metric:** Different from information gain\n",
    "   - Accounts for variable bindings\n",
    "   - Formula: `FoilGain = t × (log₂(p₁/(p₁+n₁)) - log₂(p₀/(p₀+n₀)))`\n",
    "   - Where t = positive bindings still covered\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three Types of Literals FOIL Can Add:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type 1: New Predicate with Variables**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Q(v₁, v₂, ..., vᵣ)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- At least ONE variable must already exist in rule\n",
    "- Can introduce NEW variables\n",
    "- Example: `Father(y, z)` where y exists, z is new\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type 2: Equality Test**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Equal(xᵢ, xⱼ)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Both variables must already exist\n",
    "- Tests if two objects are the same\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type 3: Negations**\n",
    "```\n",
    "¬Q(...) or ¬Equal(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Negation of Types 1 or 2\n",
    "- Example: `¬Friend(x, z)` — x and z are NOT friends"

    "    • Need lots of data\n",
    "    • Pure pattern matching\n",
