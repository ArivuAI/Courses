    "## Setting Up a Virtual Environment with Python 3.12 for Deep Learning Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a clean and manageable workspace for your deep learning projects, it is recommended to use a virtual environment. This allows you to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Install Python 3.12\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Python 3.12:**\n",
    "    - Visit the [official Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and select Python 3.12 for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Python 3.12:**\n",
    "    - **Windows:** Run the installer and follow the prompts. Make sure to check \"Add Python to PATH\" during installation.\n",
    "    - **macOS:** Download the macOS installer and run it, or use Homebrew:\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      brew install python@3.12\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**\n",

    "      sudo apt update\n",
    "      sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv python3.12-dev\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If `python3.12` is not recognized:**\n",
    "    - Check the installation path:\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      which python3.12\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - If the path is not in your `PATH` environment variable, add it (replace `/opt/homebrew/bin` with your actual path if different):\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      export PATH=\"/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH\"\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - On Windows, ensure the Python installation directory is added to your system's PATH environment variable.(replace `C:\\Python312;C:\\Python312\\Scripts` with your actual path if different):\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "        setx PATH \"%PATH%;C:\\Python312;C:\\Python312\\Scripts\" /M\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify the installation:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python3.12 --version\n",

    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install virtualenv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a new virtual environment using Python 3.12:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    virtualenv -p python3.12 module1_dl_env\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",

    "      ```bash\n",
    "      source module1_dl_env/bin/activate\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Install required packages (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn):**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install tensorflow==2.17.0 scikit-learn==1.5.0 matplotlib==3.9.0 torch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0 torchaudio==2.4.0\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Note: Keras is now included with TensorFlow 2.17.0, so no separate installation is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deactivate the environment when done with all the below experiments:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    deactivate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a virtual environment with Python 3.12 helps you manage dependencies and ensures reproducibility for your deep learning experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Install Git and Download a Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Git:**\n",
    "  - **Windows:** Download and run the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).\n",

    "## Using Python Notebooks in VS Code with a Custom Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code and use your custom Python 3.12 virtual environment, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install VS Code and Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "- Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).\n",
    "- Search for and install the **Python** extension (by Microsoft).\n",
    "- Search for and install the **Jupyter** extension (by Microsoft).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Open Your Project Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the folder containing your Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Select the Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.\n",
    "- Type `Python: Select Interpreter` and select it.\n",
    "- Choose the interpreter from your virtual environment (e.g., `./module1_dl_env/bin/python` or `.\\module1_dl_env\\Scripts\\python.exe`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Enable and Use Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open or create a `.ipynb` notebook file in VS Code.\n",
    "- At the top right of the notebook, click on the **kernel selector** (shows the current Python version).\n",
    "- Select your virtual environment as the Jupyter kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Install Jupyter in the Virtual Environment (if needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already installed Jupyter in your virtual environment, activate the environment and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Start Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can now run notebook cells using your selected virtual environment and installed packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:**  \n",
    "If your virtual environment does not appear in the kernel list, restart VS Code after activating the environment and installing the Jupyter extension. Make sure the environment is properly set up and recognized by VS Code."

    "## Updating Your Local Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep your local repository up-to-date with the latest changes from the remote repository, you'll need to pull the latest commits. This is especially important when working on collaborative projects or when the repository is frequently updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pull Latest Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following command to fetch and merge the latest changes from the master branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this command does:**\n",
    "- `git pull` combines `git fetch` (downloads changes) and `git merge` (integrates changes)\n",
    "- `origin` refers to the remote repository (typically the original source)\n",
    "- `master` specifies the branch to pull from\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always pull the latest changes before starting new work\n",
    "- Run this command periodically to stay synchronized with the repository\n",
    "- If you have local changes, commit them before pulling to avoid conflicts\n",

    "## Handling Local Changes When Pulling Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have uncommitted local changes and need to pull the latest updates from the remote repository, you might encounter conflicts. Here's a safe workflow to handle this situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Git Stash for Safe Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Stash your work-in-progress changes:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git stash push -m \"WIP\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Temporarily saves your uncommitted changes with a descriptive message\n",
    "- \"WIP\" stands for \"Work In Progress\"\n",
    "- Your working directory becomes clean, matching the last commit\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Pull latest changes with rebase:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull --rebase origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `--rebase` replays your local commits on top of the updated remote branch\n",
    "- Creates a cleaner, linear commit history compared to merge\n",
    "- Reduces unnecessary merge commits\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Restore your stashed changes:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git stash pop\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Applies the most recent stash and removes it from the stash list\n",
    "- Your work-in-progress changes are restored on top of the updated code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Workflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prevents conflicts** during pull operations\n",
    "- **Maintains clean history** with rebase instead of merge\n",
    "- **Preserves your work** even if it's not ready to commit\n",
    "- **Safe recovery** if something goes wrong (changes are safely stashed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- View stash list: `git stash list`\n",
    "- Apply stash without removing: `git stash apply`\n",
    "- Clear all stashes: `git stash clear`"
