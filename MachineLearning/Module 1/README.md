## üéì Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Well-Posed Learning Problems
- **Task (T):** What we're trying to do
- **Performance (P):** How we measure success
- **Experience (E):** What data we learn from

### 2. Concept Learning
- Learning boolean-valued functions
- Hypothesis as conjunction of constraints
- Search through hypothesis space

### 3. Find-S Algorithm
- Finds maximally specific hypothesis
- Only uses positive examples
- Simple but limited

### 4. Candidate-Elimination Algorithm
- Maintains version space (all consistent hypotheses)
- S boundary: Most specific hypotheses
- G boundary: Most general hypotheses
- Uses both positive and negative examples

### 5. Inductive Bias
- Assumptions necessary for generalization
- No bias = no generalization
- Trade-off between bias and expressiveness
