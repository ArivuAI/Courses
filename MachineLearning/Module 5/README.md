## üìä Key Concepts

### Bayesian Networks
- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Nodes = variables, edges = causal relationships
- **Conditional Independence**: Efficient probability factorization
- **Inference**: Computing P(Query | Evidence) via enumeration
- **Example**: Exam fear network (Boring ‚Üí Revised/Attended ‚Üí Scared)

### Hidden Markov Models
- **Hidden States**: Unobservable states that evolve over time
- **Observations**: What we actually see
- **Transition Probabilities**: P(S_t | S_{t-1})
- **Emission Probabilities**: P(O_t | S_t)
- **Example**: Student behavior (hidden: TV/Party/Pub/Study, observed: Tired/Hungover/Scared/Fine)

### Kalman Filter
- **State Estimation**: Optimal tracking from noisy measurements
- **Predict Step**: Forecast next state using dynamics model
- **Update Step**: Correct prediction using measurement
- **Kalman Gain**: Optimal balance between model and measurement
- **Example**: Tracking car position and velocity from noisy GPS

## üîë Key Formulas

### Bayesian Network Joint Probability
```
P(X‚ÇÅ, X‚ÇÇ, ..., X‚Çô) = ‚àè·µ¢ P(X·µ¢ | Parents(X·µ¢))
```

### HMM Forward Algorithm
```
Œ±(i,t) = P(o‚Çú | i) √ó Œ£‚±º Œ±(j,t-1) √ó P(j‚Üíi)
P(observations) = Œ£·µ¢ Œ±(i,T)
```

### HMM Viterbi Algorithm
```
Œ¥(i,t) = P(o‚Çú | i) √ó max‚±º [Œ¥(j,t-1) √ó P(j‚Üíi)]
Best path: backtrack from argmax Œ¥(i,T)
```

### Kalman Filter Predict
```
x_pred = A @ x + B @ u
P_pred = A @ P @ A.T + Q
```

### Kalman Filter Update
```
K = P @ H.T @ inv(H @ P @ H.T + R)
x = x_pred + K @ (y - H @ x_pred)
P = (I - K @ H) @ P_pred
```

## üí° Tips for Success

### Understanding the Concepts
1. **Draw the graphs**: Visualize Bayesian Networks and HMMs
2. **Work through examples by hand**: Compute probabilities manually first
3. **Understand the algorithms**: Don't just memorize formulas
4. **Connect to real applications**: Think about where you'd use each model

### Debugging Common Issues
- **Bayesian Network**: Check that CPTs sum to 1.0
- **HMM**: Use log probabilities to avoid underflow
- **Kalman Filter**: Verify matrix dimensions match
- **All models**: Start with small examples, then scale up

### Performance Optimization
- **Bayesian Networks**: Use variable elimination instead of enumeration
- **HMMs**: Vectorize operations with NumPy
- **Kalman Filter**: Pre-compute constant matrices

## ü§î Common Pitfalls

1. **Confusing causation and correlation** in Bayesian Networks
2. **Forgetting the Markov assumption** in HMMs
3. **Using Kalman Filter on non-linear systems** (use EKF instead)
4. **Not normalizing probabilities** (always check they sum to 1)
5. **Numerical underflow** in long HMM sequences (use log probabilities)
