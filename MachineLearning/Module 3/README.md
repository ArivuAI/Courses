## 🧠 Key Concepts

### Part 1: Ensemble Learning

#### AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)
**Core Idea**: Train weak classifiers sequentially, focusing on misclassified examples.

**Algorithm**:
1. Initialize equal weights for all examples
2. Train weak classifier on weighted data
3. Calculate classifier weight: α = log((1-ε)/ε)
4. Increase weights on misclassified examples
5. Repeat for T iterations
6. Combine with weighted voting

**Key Parameters**:
- `n_estimators`: Number of weak classifiers (50-200 typical)
- Base estimator: Usually decision stumps

**When to Use**:
- High bias (underfitting) problems
- Need interpretable weak learners
- Data is not too noisy

#### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
**Core Idea**: Train classifiers on bootstrap samples, combine by voting.

**Algorithm**:
1. Create B bootstrap samples (sample with replacement)
2. Train classifier on each sample
3. Combine predictions by majority vote

**Key Parameters**:
- `n_estimators`: Number of bootstrap samples (10-100 typical)
- Base estimator: Usually decision trees

**When to Use**:
- High variance (overfitting) problems
- Want parallel training
- Need out-of-bag validation

#### Random Forests
**Core Idea**: Bagging + random feature selection at each split.

**Algorithm**:
1. Create bootstrap sample
2. At each node, randomly select m features
3. Find best split among these m features
4. Grow tree fully (no pruning)
5. Repeat for B trees
6. Combine by majority vote

**Key Parameters**:
- `n_estimators`: Number of trees (100-500 typical)
- `max_features`: Features per split (√p for classification)

**When to Use**:
- Most real-world problems (best out-of-the-box)
- High-dimensional data
- Need feature importance

### Part 2: K-Means Clustering

#### K-Means Algorithm
**Core Idea**: Partition data into k clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance.

**Algorithm**:
1. Initialize k centroids randomly
2. Assign each point to nearest centroid
3. Update centroids to mean of assigned points
4. Repeat until convergence

**Key Parameters**:
- `n_clusters`: Number of clusters (k)
- `max_iterations`: Maximum iterations (100 typical)
- `random_state`: For reproducibility

**Choosing k**:
- **Elbow Method**: Plot inertia vs k, find elbow
- **Silhouette Score**: Measure cluster quality
- **Domain Knowledge**: Business context suggests k

**When to Use**:
- Spherical clusters
- Similar cluster sizes
- Numerical features
- Large datasets (K-Means is fast!)

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Ensemble Learning
1. **Start with Random Forest** - Best out-of-the-box performance
2. **Use AdaBoost for interpretability** - Weak learners are easy to understand
3. **Monitor validation error** - Prevent overfitting in AdaBoost
4. **Parallelize when possible** - Bagging and Random Forest are parallelizable
5. **Tune hyperparameters** - Number of estimators, max depth, etc.

### K-Means Clustering
1. **Always normalize features** - Critical for distance-based methods
2. **Try multiple k values** - Use elbow method and silhouette score
3. **Run multiple times** - K-Means is sensitive to initialization
4. **Remove outliers first** - K-Means is sensitive to outliers
5. **Validate with domain knowledge** - Do clusters make business sense?

## 🐛 Common Pitfalls

### Ensemble Learning
- ❌ Using too many estimators in AdaBoost (overfitting)
- ❌ Not using enough trees in Random Forest (underfitting)
- ❌ Forgetting to normalize features for distance-based weak learners
- ❌ Not monitoring out-of-bag score in bagging

### K-Means Clustering
- ❌ Forgetting to normalize features
- ❌ Using K-Means for non-spherical clusters
- ❌ Not checking multiple values of k
- ❌ Ignoring cluster interpretability
- ❌ Not handling outliers
