# Contributing to MachineLearning Course

Thank you for contributing! Use the guidelines below to add modules, experiments, or update content.

Guidelines
1. Keep notebooks self-contained: each experiment or module should include a README and `data/` folder if it needs data.
2. Use clear filenames and a consistent structure: `Module X/Module_X_Title.ipynb`, `Experiments/Experiment_Y_Title/Experiment_Y.ipynb`.
3. Small changes: commit notebooks and related files with a clear commit message describing the change.
4. Large data files: avoid committing very large datasets (>50MB). Use external storage and include a small sample in `data/` plus a download script.
5. Code style: prefer simple, readable code and include a short description and learning objective in the top cell.

How to submit
- Fork the repo, make changes on a branch, and open a pull request describing the change.
- If adding large assets, notify the maintainers via an issue first.

Contact
- Open an issue in the repository for questions or corrections.
